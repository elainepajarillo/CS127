# Document Management System (modeled on SAIS)
Project where we manage data of the university in terms of online processes just like in SAIS. The class is divided into six groups that are each focused on one specific function of the system.
This project will include both front-end and back-end but the latter will be heavily emphasized since the course is about database systems. SQL will be the main language in this project.

## Teacher Grading System and Class Scheduling
Main topic assigned to my group. This repo will include more details regarding this topic than the rest since we will be more hands-on with this, but all parts of the system will be uploaded.

## First Task
The first task for our group is to make an ERD for our topic. We have to set relationships and predict every possible data that will be needed and make the diagram.
